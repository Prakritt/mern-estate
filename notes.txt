Inside App.jsx:
    import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'
    return <BrowserRouter>
        <Routes>
        <Route path = "/" element={<Home/>}/>
        <Route path ="/sign-in" element={<SignIn/>}/>
        <Route path = "/sign-up" element={<SignUp/>}/>
        <Route path = "/profile" element ={<Profile/>}/>
        <Route path = "/about" element ={<About/>}/>
        
        </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>



For components, components are stored inside "components" folder inside "src" folder. 
Header component will be placed between BrowserRouter and Route as: 
    <BrowserRouter>

We can get icons from the package react-icons: npm install react-icons:
    import {FaSearch} from 'react-icons/fa'

To redirect on a click:
    import {Link} from 'react-router-dom'
    Link redirects us from one page to the another without refreshing the page.
